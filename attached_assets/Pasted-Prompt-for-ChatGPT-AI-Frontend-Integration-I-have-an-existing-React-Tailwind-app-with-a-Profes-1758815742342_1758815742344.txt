Prompt for ChatGPT / AI Frontend Integration

“I have an existing React + Tailwind app with a Professional dashboard already built. I want to add a Student dashboard that is colorful, simple, and consistent with my current design.

The Student dashboard should integrate with my existing backend (Express + SQLite) running on Replit, which exposes these endpoints:

GET /wallet/1 → returns { balance_rupees }

POST /wallet/1/pay → accepts { to, amount_rupees, type } and returns updated balance

GET /wallet/1/transactions → returns transaction history

The Student dashboard should have these features:

Wallet Balance: Show current wallet balance fetched from backend

Add Expenses / Transfer Money: Form to send payments to a friend; updates balance and backend transactions

Transaction History: Display a table or cards with all transactions fetched from backend

Savings Goals: Show goals with progress bars

Notifications / Scam Alerts: Placeholder section for messages like ‘⚠️ Fake internship detected’

Fun / Gamification elements: Badges for saving or spending wisely

Requirements:

Maintain the same design language and Tailwind styling as the existing Professional dashboard

Make it colorful, clean, and student-friendly

All API calls should point to the Replit backend (https://<your-replit>.repl.co)

Show real-time balance updates after transactions

Keep sandbox mode — no real money is moved

Include responsive design for desktop and mobile

Output: Please generate the full StudentDashboard.tsx React component code with Tailwind classes and all Axios calls integrated to the backend.”

✅ How to use

Replace <your-replit> with your Replit project’s public URL.

Paste this prompt into ChatGPT (or Replit AI) and ask it to generate the code.

Copy the generated StudentDashboard.tsx into your src/components/dashboard/ folder.

Import it into your role-selection flow so that choosing Student loads this new dashboard.

Test — you should now see wallet balance, send dummy payments, and view transactions, all in a student-friendly UI.
